# CarbonFootprintCalculator
Calculate your carbon footprint, and find out how much you have to do to eliminate it!

# What is "Carbon footprint"?
A carbon footprint is historically defined as the total emissions caused by an individual, event, organisation, or product, expressed as carbon dioxide equivalent.


# Who is this for?

This calculator is for anyone using electricity, who wants to know how much carbon footprint they produce, and eliminate it (by presenting the output equivalent to trees planted). This is called offsetting the carbon footprint. Of course, electricity is just a fraction of our total carbon footprint. But if you consume a lot of it, you might want to do something. Originally the calculator was made for Cryptocurrency miners, as they are very energy intensive.
